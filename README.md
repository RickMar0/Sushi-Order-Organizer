little organizer for your sushi orders

for example:

Friend 1: 12, 8, 15
Friend 2: 8, 10, 20
Friend 3: 15, 12, 25
Friend 4: 10, 12, 8

my program will process that to become:

8 x 3
10 x 2
12 x 3
15 x 2
20 x 1
25 x 1

which is way easier to forward to your friends or sushi place of choice
have fun and bone apple tea!
